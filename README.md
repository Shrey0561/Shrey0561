# Hi, I'm Shreya!
**Aspiring Data Analyst | People, Patterns & Psychology**

I'm curious about human behavior and driven to find meaning in the mess. I use data to explore the *why* behind what people do and translate those insights into clarity and action.

With a background in psychology and data analysis, I enjoy creating structure in workflows, decision-making, and sometimes even in the games I play. I thrive in spaces where curiosity meets logic, ideally with a controller in one hand and a notebook in the other.

## Tech I'm Working with 
`SQL` `Excel` `Power BI`
